# Advent of Code 2022

Python solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Philosophy

Using the AoC problems as a way to hone scripting skills, with the following
design choices:

- Each problem is an independent script
- Striving more for clarity than brevity
- No other code loaded except python libraries
- Each script takes the name of the input file as an parameter
- Scripts use a common template and there is some code duplication
- Using not hints or other people's code. Nothing but AoC's official page
- Solutions are not changed once they are submitted so I can learn by comparing to other people's solutions
